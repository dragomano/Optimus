Here is a list of all events generated by Optimus that can be intercepted by addons:

| Event                             | Description                                                                                           |
| :-------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AddonInterface::HOOK_EVENT`      | Universal event for working with SMF hooks                                                            |
| `AddonInterface::ROBOTS_RULES`    | Event for working with the `robots.txt` rules generator                                               |
| `AddonInterface::SITEMAP_LINKS`   | Event for working with the XML sitemap generator                                                      |
| `AddonInterface::SITEMAP_CONTENT` | Special event for processing the content of the XML sitemap immediately after its structure is formed |
| `AddonInterface::CREATE_SEF_URLS` | Special event for processing links in the XML sitemap before its structure is formed                  |

To implement a connection with the selected event in the addon class, you need to fill in the `$events` field and create the `__invoke` method. For example, in the `LightPortal` addon, it looks like this:

```php
public static array $events = [
	self::ROBOTS_RULES,
	self::SITEMAP_LINKS,
];

public function __invoke(AddonEvent $event): void
{
	match ($event->eventName()) {
		self::ROBOTS_RULES  => $this->changeRobots($event->getTarget()),
		self::SITEMAP_LINKS => $this->changeSitemap($event->getTarget()),
	};
}
```

Then we create the corresponding methods `changeRobots` and `changeSitemap` (you can name them as you wish):

```php
public function changeRobots(RobotsGenerator $robots): void
{
	var_dump($robots);
}

public function changeSitemap(SitemapGenerator $sitemap): void
{
	var_dump($sitemap);
}
```

As you can see, the event object `self::ROBOTS_RULES` passes the `RobotsGenerator` class for working with the `robots.txt` generator.

Similarly, the event object `self::SITEMAP_LINKS` passes the `SitemapGenerator` class for working with the XML sitemap generator.

From there, it all depends on your creativity and specific goals. Examples of implementations of built-in addons can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dragomano/Optimus/blob/main/src/Sources/Optimus/Addons).

If you find the events insufficient or overwhelming, you can alternatively use [built-in hooks](../hooks) in Optimus.
