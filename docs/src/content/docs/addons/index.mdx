Addons are designed to interact with other modifications, such as portals. Why? Because sometimes tasks arise, such as adding portal pages to the forum sitemap. The set of installed modifications varies for everyone, and to avoid cluttering the Optimus core with all existing hacks to support everything, the corresponding code has been moved to separate classes and files. From now on, upon the first launch, Optimus checks and caches (and then regularly synchronizes) the list of modifications installed on the forum, and when supported ones are detected, the corresponding addons are activated.

Additionally, there are Optimus-specific addons that add various features, such as extended settings.

Some addons are already included in the Optimus distribution, while others can be downloaded and added at your discretion.
