Sometimes there is a need to set up a redirect from one page (usually a non-existent one) to another.

Not everyone has the time or skills to edit the `.htaccess` file for this purpose. In such cases, this section will come to your aid.

For example, if you want users accessing the address `?action=my_page` to automatically be redirected to `?action=other_page`, add a new redirect by entering `action=my_page` => `action=other_page`.

If you need to redirect to an external resource outside of your forum, make sure to specify the full link.
