After successfully installing the mod, you will automatically be taken to the Optimus settings page. You can also access it by navigating to "Configuration => Search Engine Optimization" in the SMF admin panel.

The main secret to successfully using and mastering Optimus is to leave what works alone. If you are satisfied with the current settings, do not experiment; continue using them. Experiment only on a local or test site.

If the meaning of a particular option is unclear, read its description in this documentation. If you encounter a term you don't understand (like meta tag, `description`, etc.), do a quick search online.

The modification settings are divided into tabbed sections for ease of use. At the top of each tab, there is a link to helpful reference information.
