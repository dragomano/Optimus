When adding a new site to Google Search Console (or another similar service), you are usually asked to confirm your ownership of the website in one way or another.

Choose the option "via meta tag", specify this meta tag in the settings below, and voilà — the service will recognize you.

If the required tag is not initially in the list, you can add it.

Additionally, you are free to use this tab to add any other additional meta tags by specifying their name and value.
