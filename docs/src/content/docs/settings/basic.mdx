## Topic & Board Pages
---
<Steps>
1. ### Add Forum Name to Board Titles

    Choose from 3 options.

    Let's say your forum is called "Secret Bikers Club of L.A." and you have a section titled "Good Bars". When you enter the section and look at the page title, the result will depend on the option you choose:

    | Option             |                     Result               |
    | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------: |
    | Don't add          |         No changes (`Good Bars`)         |
    | Before Board Title | `Secret Bikers Club of L.A. - Good Bars` |
    | After Board Title  | `Good Bars - Secret Bikers Club of L.A.` |

2. ### Add Title of Section and Forum to Topic Titles

    Choose from 3 options.

    Imagine you have a topic titled "November Meetup" in the "Good Bars" section:

    | Option             |                              Result                        |
    | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
    | Don't add          |                  No changes (`November Meetup`)            |
    | Before Topic Title | `Secret Bikers Club of L.A. - Good Bars - November Meetup` |
    | After Topic Title  | `November Meetup - Good Bars - Secret Bikers Club of L.A.` |

    Don't need these options? Don't enable them if you don't want to. Let's move on.

3. ### Display the Topic First Message Snippet as the Meta-Tag `description`

    A lazy option if you don't want to manually come up with/fill in topic descriptions.

4. ### Allow a Separate Field for the Topic Description

    An option for the meticulous, allowing you to create a description for each topic separately. Don't forget to set permissions for the user groups you want to allow to fill in descriptions.

5. ### Allow a Separate Field for the Topic Tags

    Similarly, for filling in tags. They won't be filled in automatically. Don't forget to set permissions for the user groups you want to allow to fill in tags.

6. ### Display a Block with Tags Above the First Post of the Topic

    Filled in the tags? Great! Want to display them? Then enable this option.

7. ### Display Tags in Topic Lists Within Boards

    They will look very nice, check it out.

8. ### Use Color Tags

    If you enable this, the tags will look even better.

9. ### Maximum Number of Tags Per Topic

    A measure of control to prevent overly enthusiastic users from overloading your forum with tags.
