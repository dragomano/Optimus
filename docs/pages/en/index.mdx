# Greetings

This documentation is dedicated to the Optimus v3 modification (formerly known as SMF Optimus or Optimus Brave) for forums running on the SMF engine.

To successfully install and use it, you will need:

* SMF 2.1+
* PHP 8.1+

First, let's determine whether you need **Optimus** or not.

This modification will be useful for you if you want to:

* Eliminate the need for manual editing of `index.template.php` and other SMF source files
* Optimize your forum for search engines with minimal effort
* Add descriptions and tags to the topics created on the forum
* Implement the correct HTTP status for non-existent or unavailable sections and topics
* Track what users are searching for on your forum
* Automatically generate Open Graph markup
* Customize the forum icon
* Create an XML sitemap on a schedule, with settings for the addresses included in the map
* Have quick access to edit `.htaccess` and `robots.txt` files
* Set up redirects for certain forum addresses
* Quickly add tracking codes or analytics (Google Analytics, Google AdSense, Yandex.Metrica, etc.)

So, if any of the above features sound appealing to you â€” go ahead, [download and install the mod](https://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=2659).
