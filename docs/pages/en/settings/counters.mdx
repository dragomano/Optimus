# AdSense/JS Code

This tab represents the most basic option for replacing the Ad Management mod and similar functionalities. You simply insert the JS script in its original form, as provided by the corresponding service, into one of the fields below, and everything works.

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

## Available Settings

<Steps>
### Invisible JS with Loading in the Head Section

A field for scripts like Google Analytics, Google AdSense, etc.

### Invisible JS with Loading in the Body Section

A field for scripts like Yandex.Metrica, etc.

### Visible JS (Image Counters, Banners, etc.)

A field for any visual counters that display visit numbers, etc.

### Appearance for Visible Counters (CSS Code)

Here you can customize the appearance of visible counters to fit the design of your forum.

### Ignored Actions

Some areas are already specified by default where none of the scripts you provided will be loaded.

For example, it is pointless to load advertising scripts in the admin panel, as bots will not have access there anyway.
