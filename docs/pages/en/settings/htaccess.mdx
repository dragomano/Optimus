# Manage `.htaccess`

Sometimes you need to quickly edit something in the `.htaccess` file, and accessing the hosting panel or using FTP may seem complicated or even too time-consuming for many.

For example, after removing the PrettyURLs modification, which makes changes to this file, the changes may remain and could lead to issues later on.

If the file does not exist but you need to create it, simply fill in the field and save the changes, and the file will be created.

In such cases, this tab will assist you.
