Let's say your forum is called "Secret Bikers Club of L.A." and you have a section titled "Good Bars". When you enter the section and look at the page title, the result will depend on the option you choose:

| Before Board Title | `Secret Bikers Club of L.A. - Good Bars` |
| After Board Title  | `Good Bars - Secret Bikers Club of L.A.` |

### Add Title of Section and Forum to Topic Titles

Choose from 3 options.

Imagine you have a topic titled "November Meetup" in the "Good Bars" section:

| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
| Don't add          |                  No changes (`November Meetup`)            |
