# Manage `robots.txt`

The tab consists of two columns. The left column contains recommended (but not mandatory) rules, while the right column allows you to directly edit the contents of `robots.txt`.

The rules generator may change its recommendations after the installation of certain mods (such as portals). You will need to reflect these changes in the right column.

You are free to ignore the generator's rules and write your own if you are familiar with the nuances.
