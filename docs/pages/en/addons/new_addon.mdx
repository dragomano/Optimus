# How to Create Your Own Addon

Anyone interested can write their own addon. The main rule is to know at least the basics of working with PHP code (ideally, Object-Oriented Programming). In the repository, there is an [example of a simple addon](https://github.com/dragomano/Optimus/blob/main/src/Sources/Optimus/Addons/ExampleAddon.php), let's break it down:

```php {5, 7-9, 17, 21} showLineNumbers copy filename="ExampleAddon.php"
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

final class ExampleAddon extends AbstractAddon
{
	public const PACKAGE_ID = 'Optimus:ExampleAddon';

	public static array $events = [
		self::HOOK_EVENT,
	];

	public function __invoke(AddonEvent $event): void
	{
		if ($event->eventName() !== self::HOOK_EVENT)
			return;

		IntegrationHook::add(
			'integrate_theme_context', self::class . '::hideSomeTopicsFromSpiders#', false, __FILE__
		);
	}

	public function hideSomeTopicsFromSpiders(): void
	{
		if (empty(Utils::$context['topicinfo']))
			return;

		if (Utils::$context['topicinfo']['locked'] || Utils::$context['topicinfo']['num_replies'] < 2) {
			Utils::$context['meta_tags'][] = ['name' => 'robots', 'content' => 'noindex,nofollow'];
		}
	}
}
```

The addon class must extend the existing abstract class `AbstractAddon` and have a constant `PACKAGE_ID` that specifies the package identifier. If the addon is intended to connect with an existing modification, its ID can be found in `package-info.xml` under the `id` node — for example, `<id>Bugo:Optimus</id>`.

If it is a built-in Optimus addon, the identifier starts with `Optimus:`, followed by the name of the current class. If your addon is not related to any existing modification but you want it to work with Optimus, use a similar identifier.

Next, in the static property `$events`, you specify an array that returns the events supported specifically by this addon. `self::HOOK_EVENT` is a [universal event](events) designed for interaction with SMF hooks. An example of working with it is provided in the `__invoke` method.

Using `IntegrationHook::add`, we specify the hook we need and link it to a method within the addon class.

Then, the linked method performs its task. Specifically, in this addon — `ExampleAddon` — a meta tag `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow">` is added to the pages of blocked topics, as well as to topics with fewer than two replies. If you need such an addon, save its code in the corresponding file `ExampleAddon.php` and place it in the `Sources/Optimus/Addons` directory. You won't need to enable anything separately; it will work immediately.

All available addons operate on the same principle.
